# Initial Challenge to Apply as PM for PBN's Translation

Hello potential new PBN builder! If you have found this page it's because you are willing to apply for a job at PlanB Network as a Project Manager for PBN Platform Translation â€” if not you're just a lost and curious soul in github, and I suggest you to have a look on [PlanB Network](https://planb.network). 

So the first application step is a challenge for you to complete via a PR toward this branch with a subfolder `hiring/username/` which is composed of the following
- [ ] a pbn-builder.yml file based on the template about yourself
- [ ] a folder `assets/` with your profil pic in `webp` format
- [ ] add a folder with a [tutorial]([url](https://github.com/DecouvreBitcoin/sovereign-university-data/tree/dev/tutorials)) of your choice and translate it in 2 different languages that are not present in the repo using [LLM-Translator](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator)
- [ ] encrypt all the files of `hiring/username` with my [PGP public key](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/pgp-public-keys/blob/master/asi0-pk.asc)
- [ ] add a md file that log how you have completed that challenge with a synthetic tone
